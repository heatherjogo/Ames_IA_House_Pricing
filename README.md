### Problem Statement:

As a Realtor in Ames, Iowa, your goal is to help clients sell their homes at a highest price, sell it quickly, and with the least hassle for the homeowner. However, even if a homeowner is ready to sell, sometimes the house itself isnâ€™t. How can data science help listing agents direct their clients toward areas of improvement that will maximize their investment in terms of increased house value?



### Executive Summary

For this analysis, I leveraged the Ames Housing Datasets which were created by the Ames Assessors Office. The data include statistics about roughly 3000 homes which were sold in Ames, Iowa between 2006 and 2010. The datasets, which are split in to training and testing files, contain over 80 features about the houses and properties sold in Ames during this time. Through data cleansing, exploration and analysis, followed by linear regression modeling, I have developed a model that identifies the key drivers of sale price with an eye toward features which the homeown can improve prior to listing their house, in order to increase their selling price. 

A secondary goal of this project was to develop a model to compete in a Kaggle Challenge. To this end, I also created a model that focused on maximizing R2 scores. This model was different from the one developed to identify areas for home and property improvement, so I will detail the differences in the Data Dictionary below. 

### Data Sources
* [`train.csv`](./datasets/train.csv): Ames Housing Data Training Dataset | [data dictionary](http://jse.amstat.org/v19n3/decock/DataDocumentation.txt))

### Modeling Data Files
* [`ames_train_transform.csv`](./datasets/ames_train_transform.csv): Ames Housing Data Training Dataset with Transformed fields and new features (see Data Dictionary below)
* [`ames_test_transform.csv`](./datasets/ames_test_transform.csv): Ames Housing Data Testing Dataset with Transformed fields and new features
* submission_#.csv: Kaggle submission files containing Id and Saleprice fields. All files were uploaded to Kaggle for scoring.

### Conclusions and Recommendations

The strongest predictors of house value from the Home Value model were Overall Home Quality, Above Ground Square Footage, Total House Square Footage (incl Basement), being located in the Northridge Heights neighborhood, and Exterior Quality of the home. 

The Home Value model had an R2 score of 0.88, meaning about 88% of variations in sale price of an Ames home can be explained by the model 

Realtors should direct homeowners to improve the following features of their homes in order to maximize house value:
* Overall Quality, including the finishes and materials throughout the house
* Exterior Quality, materials on the exterior of the house
* Basement Condition, including decreasing dampness and any structural damage
* Number of Fireplaces
* Above Ground Square Footage
* Basement Square Footage
* Porch or Deck, either add or increase square footage
* Bathrooms, add new or convert a half bath to full bath

For the Kaggle Challenge, the strongest predictors of home sale price were:
* Total house square footage x Overall quality score
* Basement square footage x Basement ceiling height score
* Basement condition
* Overall quality x overall condition of house
* Year built

The Kaggle model had an R2 score of 0.919, meaning about 92% of variation in sale price of an Ames home can be explained by the model.
